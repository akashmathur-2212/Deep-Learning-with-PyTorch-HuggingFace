**Setup with UV**

To replicate the exact development environment, this project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). All dependencies are defined in pyproject.toml and locked in uv.lock.

1. [Install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) UV (if not already installed):

2. Sync the environment:

```
uv sync
```

This will install all required dependencies as specified in the lock file.
